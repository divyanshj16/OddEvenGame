# OddEvenGame
Its a game which is very famous in India basically played between kids as a tie-breaker or toss or a kind of hand cricket. I made this program to simulate the cricket format of this game between the player and computer.(Based on random interger)

RULES OF THE GAME:
1. Player has to select Odd or Even.
2. Then the player enters a number between 1-6 and computer computes a number between 1-6. The numbers are added and the sum    is checked to be odd or even if the sum is same as selected by the user the user wins the toss.
3. Then the player has its batting. Score gets added until the player and computer numbers are same and player gets out.
4. Then its computer turn and the player has to bowl (however he is doing the same task i.e entering number but this time its    computer score which get added up.)
5. If player has more score he wins!!
